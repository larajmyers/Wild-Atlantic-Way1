<h1 class=introh><b>Wild Atlantic Way</b></h1>
<h2 class="introh"> Welcome to the Wild Atlantic Way</h2>


<p class="introp">The Wild Atlantic Way, 1600 miles (2600 km) in length, is one of the longest defined coastal routes in the world. It winds its way all along the Irish west coast from the Inishowen Peninsula in the north down to the picturesque town of Kinsale, County Cork, in the south.</p>
<p class="introp">The Wild Atlantic Way route from start to finish unfolds the wonders of nature, the power of the ocean and its imprint on the west coast of Ireland, and the stunning countryside in all its diversity. Enchanting villages are nestled along the coast as well as ancient monuments – their origins having long sunk into the mists of oblivion dot the landscape. Behind every bend on this magical coastal road a new delight awaits.
The wild Atlantic with its unrestrained and untameable tides and storms has continuously been moulding the west coast of Ireland. With a constant meeting of water and land, a deeply indented and wild terrain has emerged with towering cliffs, spellbinding bays and beaches, mystical islands, always changing and never reaching the end. In the isolation or perhaps expressed in a different way living near and with the Atlantic at your doorstep has ensured that old traditions and the Irish language have been preserved. A trip along the Wild Atlantic Way is also an encounter with the past.</p>

<p class="introp">The Wild Atlantic Way celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2024. Whether you've travelled along the 2,500km route before or are planning your first visit, you can look to the 180 Discovery Points to guide you on your journey, each marked with a distinctive Wild Atlantic Way signpost. Or get a taste of the very best views and historical sites with the 15 Signature Points along the route.</p>
<h2 class="introh">Donegal</h2>
<p class="introp"><b>Malin Head</b> | Ireland’s most northerly point, Malin Head in Donegal is filled with wildlife, striking rock formations and an interesting history. Check out the watchtower at Banba’s Crown, named after the patron goddess of Ireland. Erected in 1805, the tower was built to keep lookout in case Napoleon tried to invade Ireland and it still holds the title of the country's most northerly structure. </p>
<p class="introp"><b>Fanad Head </b> | makes for a great pitstop for those who can't stay away from a good beach. Take your shoes off on the beach at Ballymastocker Bay and enjoy a long walk on the sandy shores. After, make your way to the famous Fanad Lighthouse and get a tour to learn how lighthouse keepers once lived. </p>

<h2 class="introh">Sligo</h2>
<p class="introp"> <b>Downpatrick Head </b>| Named after St Patrick, Downpatrick Head still shows remnants left behind by the saint himself. Walk along the 126ft cliffside and uncover the ruins of St Patrick's Church, which he founded back in the 5th century. </p>
<p class="introp"> <b>Keem Bay </b>| Tucked away on Ireland's largest island Acaill (Achill Island), Keem Bay is a great place to find a bit of peace and quiet on your travels. Admire the nearby cliffs of Benmore and Croaghaun Mountain, and discover the Deserted Village which was abandoned in the early 20th century. </p>

<h2 class="introh">Galway</h2>
<p class="introp"><b>Killary Harbour </b> | One of only three glacial fjords in Ireland, Killary Harbour not only creates a natural border between Galway and Mayo but is also known for its beautiful scenery. Set along the Connemara Loop, walk the 16km stretch and soak up views of Connacht's highest mountain, Mweelrea, as well as the Maumturk Mountains. </p>
<p class="introp"><b>Derrigimlagh </b>| The stark blanket bog of Derrigimlagh has an unusual claim to fame. The pioneering pilots Alcock and Brown crash-landed to safety here after completing the world’s first transatlantic flight in 1919. Navigate through the patchwork landscape of small lakes and peat bog to find another emblem of aeronautical history, the remains of the world's first permanent transatlantic radio station which was burned to the ground during the Irish War of Independence. </p>

<h2 class="introh">Clare</h2>
<p class="introp"> <b>Cliffs Of Moher</b> | A destination that attracts people from all over the world, the towering Cliffs of Moher in Clare boasts uninterrupted views of the Atlantic. Head to O’Brien’s Tower and gaze out to sea towards the Árainn (Aran Islands) or, if the conditions are right, keep your eyes peeled for thrill-seeker surfers trying to conquer the powerful Aileen’s Wave at the base of the cliffs.  </p>
<p class="introp"> <b>Loop Head </b> | Find panoramic cliff views, seaside villages and a lighthouse that’s served as a beacon for those at sea since 1670 on Loop Head Peninsula. Plan your trip during the summer months to see the vibrant purple heather that takes hold of the landscape and, of course, the Atlantic swell that crashes into the impressive cliffs.   </p>

<h2 class="introh">Kerry</h2>
<p class="introp"> <b>An Blascaod Mór (The Blasket Islands)</b> | Out on the very edge of Europe, off the Dingle Peninsula in Kerry, lies An Blascaod Mór of the Blasket Islands. Just 2km from mainland, hop on a boat and learn about what life was like on the island, from the small Irish-speaking community who once lived there and their daily hardships to the last group of islanders who emigrated in 1953. Visit The Blasket Centre and immerse yourself in the island's culture through interactive exhibitions that bring the island's past into the present.  </p>
<p class="introp"> <b>Na Scealga (Skellig Islands) </b> |Famous for their sacred pilgrimage site and their starring role in the Star Wars franchise, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Na Scealga (Skellig Islands) is made up of two sandstone rocks steeply rising out of the Atlantic Ocean. Just 11km off the Iveragh Peninsula, head to the shore on a clear day to admire them in the distance or check the timetables of local boat operators and set sail on a day-trip to get a closer look. </p>

<h2 class="introh">Cork</h2>
<p class="introp"> <b>Dursey Island</b> | Off the Cork coast lies Dursey Island, the most westerly of the county’s inhabited islands and home to just three families. To visit the island, board Ireland’s only cable car service and travel across the beautiful Dursey Sound – you might even find yourself sharing the ride with farmers herding their sheep and cattle. </p>
<p class="introp"> <b>Mizen Head</b> | The craggy clifftop of Mizen Head is an ideal place to begin your journey north along the Wild Atlantic Way. Catch sight of the imposing Fastnet Lighthouse, perched on a rock known as ‘Ireland’s Teardrop’. For many emigrants during the Great Famine, this was the last part of Ireland they saw as they sailed away to America. </p>
