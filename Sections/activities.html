<h1 class="activities-h1">10 Activities to do in the Wild Atlantic Way</h1>

<h2 class="activties-h2">Go stargazing in Mayo</h2>
<p class="activities-p">When the weather is clear, you're met with a blanket of twinkling stars and galaxies in
sky overhead, with no light pollution to impede the view. The best place for stargazing is
at <b>Mayo Dark Sky Park</b>, set among the wilds of the Nephin Mountains in Ballycroy.

<h2 class="activties-h2">Walk along the Cliffs of Moher</h2>
<p class="activities-p">Stand on top of the <b>Cliffs of Moher</b> in <b>County Clare</b> and it’s hard not to be overcome by the sheer beauty of it all, as seabirds swoop between the rocks and the waves crash hundreds of metres below your feet. Wherever you turn, the views are epic, whether you walk along the clifftop path towards Hag’s Head or take it in from the wind-whipped observation point of O’Brien’s Tower. If you really want an adventure, hike to the cliffs from Doolin along the Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk, with mesmerising views of the cliffs and the sea all along the 8km route.</p>

<h2 class="activties-h2">Forage for seaweed in Kerry</h2>
<p class="activities-p">The Wild Atlantic Way is a treasure trove for seaweed, whether you are soaking in a seaweed bath in Sligo or sipping a kelp gin in West Cork. But edible seaweed is prolific all along the shoreline, and it’s delicious to boot. Take a seaweed discovery walk with Atlantic Irish Seaweed and you’ll stroll along some beautiful beaches such as Derrynane on the Kerry coast, learning how to identify the native Irish seaweed and enjoying some nibbles along the way.</p>

<h2 class="activties-h2">Go night kayaking in West Cork</h2>
<p class="activities-p">The Wild Atlantic Way is studded with lighthouses perched on the edge of dramatic peninsulas along the route, but one that you won’t want to miss is Fastnet Rock. This tiny jagged island was known as “Ireland’s Teardrop” as it was the last sight emigrants would glimpse of Ireland on their journey across the Atlantic. The lighthouse here is the wildest and tallest rock lighthouse in Ireland and can be visited on a day trip with Fastnet Tour from Baltimore or Schull in County Cork. You can’t land on the island, but the trip is an adventure in itself and whales and dolphins are frequently spotted en route.</p>

<h2 class="activties-h2">Fly between the sea stacks in Donegal</h2>
<p class="activities-p">All along the western shore there are incredible sea stacks, from the towering pile of Downpatrick Head in County Mayo up to the jagged peaks of Malin Head in County Donegal. And it’s there, in the northernmost county on the Wild Atlantic Way, where you can experience the sea stacks up close on a zip-lining adventure with Unique Ascent. On a Tyrolean traverse, you’ll glide between the rocky outcrops for an unbeatable adrenaline rush, with epic views to boot. But if that’s not your speed, you can still enjoy these geological marvels from the shore, on a picturesque stroll along the cliffs.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="activties-h2">See the Skelligs in Kerry</h2>
<p class="activities-p">For hundreds of years, the jagged island of Skellig Michael has been a sanctuary, whether that was for the monks who called it home in the 6th century, or for Luke Skywalker when the island doubled as his haven in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Skellig Michael is a uniquely striking spot, so otherworldly that it was the perfect backdrop for science fiction. Take a boat trip out there and you can climb the ancient stone steps and walk around the centuries-old beehive huts, surrounded by the vastness of the ocean. Keep your eyes peeled for the native seabirds, including the puffins who visit the island in the late spring.</p>

<h2 class="activties-h2">Learn how to shuck oysters at the Flaggy Shore</h2>
<p class="activities-p">Oysters taste their best when eaten with the scent of the sea in the air, the salt of the ocean pairing with the salinity of these delectable little treats. But why not go one step further, and learn how to shuck them yourself? At Flaggy Shore Oysters, you can learn all about how oysters are grown before mastering the art of shucking them, just steps from the crystal clear water. Then comes the best part – enjoying the freshest oysters you’ll ever eat with a specially selected glass of organic wine.</p>

<h2 class="activties-h2">See Slieve League from the water</h2>
<p class="activities-p">Sure, the soaring cliffs of Donegal’s Slieve League are impressive when you see them from above. But the views are breath-taking from below, where you can really get a sense of their sheer scale on a boat trip that takes you right underneath these towering sea cliffs. Head out with Sliabh Liag Boat Trips and you’ll sail along the base of the cliffs, hearing about the myths and legends associated with the area and possibly spotting some dolphins, too. If you’re feeling brave, you can even take a dip in the dazzling blue waters – just wear a wetsuit in the cooler months.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="activties-h2">Cycle the Great Western Greenway</h2>
<p class="activities-p">There are hundreds of stunning islands off the west coast of Ireland, but Achill is one of the few that you can reach by car. And it’s even better when you approach it on two wheels, by cycling the Great Western Greenway all the way from Westport to Achill, skirting along the edge of Clew Bay. The route is 30 miles in total but you don’t have to bike the whole thing – the final nine mile stretch from Mulranny to Achill is a joy, with mesmerising views of the mountains and the sea keeping you company as you cycle.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="activties-h2">Take a cable car to Dursey Island</h2>
<p class="activities-p">Travel on Ireland’s only cable car and you’ll be met with spectacular views, whether you’re gazing down at the swirling waters of Dursey Sound or looking out over the lush green hills of the island itself. Once you’re on Dursey Island, you can walk over the wild slopes, passing the resident sheep as you go, before finding the most scenic spot for a picnic. Keep an eye on the water, though – this area is a hotspot for dolphins and whales, and there are plenty of seabirds flitting around too.</p>
